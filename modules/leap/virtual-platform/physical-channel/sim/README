sim-physical-channel-software.awb

This awb file changes the type of the simulation physical channel
module from physical_channel to sim_physical_channel, allowing builds
supporting multiple physical channels to import the pipe-based
softaware implementation and other physical device implementations.

This awb file relies on union dir from the leap repository in order
find its files.
